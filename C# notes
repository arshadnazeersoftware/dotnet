Architecture has to have attributes of logic, power and design.
Architecture has to have logical, powerful and design attributes.
Architecture level has something to do with:
1.
Pillar:
Abstraction
Encapsulation
Inheritance
Polymorphism
2. 
Abilities
3.
Features
4. What is my reasoning in the context of current theory of the following:
What is design and architecture?
What is object oriented programming structure?
What is abstraction?
What is ecapsulation?
What is polymorphism?
What is inheritance?

Software Engineering - containers, data.
What are the concepts to create an architecture?
Have mathematical perspective of things.
Begin verificiation and confirmation.
Learn from examples.
Build a design and architecture based on a framework using constructs in C#.
In my theory and reasoning all of the following is an Example:
1. Framework
2. Design and Architecture
3. Constructs
Based on examples I will improve logic and create a unified understanding by using mathematics and could represent it.
